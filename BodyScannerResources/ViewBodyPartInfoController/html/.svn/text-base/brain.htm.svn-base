When you become aware of a threatening situation, your brain sets into motion a chain reaction in your body,
turning on some systems and shutting down others.  
Adrenaline and stress hormones start pumping through
your blood stream, affecting how you feel, how you think and how you act.  
And all the time, your brain continues to monitor the situaion and your body's reaction to it.
